## Example ##


    >> inpainting
    iteration    0, primal residual = 1.00e+00, dual residual = 1.00e+00 
    iteration   20, primal residual = 4.64e-02, dual residual = 8.08e-03 
    iteration   40, primal residual = 2.21e-04, dual residual = 3.13e-05 
    iteration   60, primal residual = 1.60e-06, dual residual = 2.20e-07 
    iteration   80, primal residual = 1.35e-08, dual residual = 1.73e-09 
    ===================================================
    DONE, ADMM found solution in   82 steps (  6.5 seconds).
    The final primal residual = 8.36e-09 
    The final dual residual = 1.07e-09 
    ||u_admm - u_ls|| = 1.3884e-07
